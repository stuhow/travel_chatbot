SalesGPT for an AI travel agent specialising in group tours
I have adoped a similar approach to SalesGPT (https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT)
There were a number of limitations to this approach which I have tried to mitigate:
- No direction to what details are gathered
- Had a tendancy to skip steps
- Memory is stored locally and the whole chat history is passeed to the prompt
