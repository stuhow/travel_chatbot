The departure dates for the tour are April 6, 8, 13, and 15 in 2024. The cost of the tour is £2769. The travel style is Classic, offering all the highlights and cultural experiences at a great price. The physical grading is 4, meaning it includes some high-altitude hikes and strenuous activities but is accessible to most healthy travelers. \n",

      "For the Lares Trek itinerary, the tour starts with a visit to Puno and Lake Titicaca, followed by a guided tour and homestay in a small village. The tour then continues to Cusco, where a full-day guided tour of the Sacred Valley is included. The highlight of this itinerary is the Lares Trek, a demanding hike that takes travelers through scenic landscapes and ancient ruins, culminating in a visit to Machu Picchu. The tour ends with a visit to Puerto Maldonado and the G Lodge Amazon.\n",
